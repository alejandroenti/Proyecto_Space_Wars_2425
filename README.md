# Proyecto_Space_Wars_2425

## Brief Description
Space Wars is a video game where we control the army of a planet that is under continuous attack from enemy planets. By upgrading the planet's technology and purchasing new ships, we try to withstand the enemy waves that wish to conquer us.

The planet generates resources every minute, which are necessary to upgrade technology and buy ships. Additionally, we can earn these materials by winning battles.
